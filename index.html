			<textarea class="lined">JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan</br>
			Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, 
				which was later renamed to LiveScript, 
				and finally to JavaScript. 

				The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly 
				coincided with Netscape adding support for 
				Java technology in its Netscape Navigator 
				web browser. 

				JavaScript was first introduced 
				and deployed in the Netscape browser version 
				2.0B3 in December 1995. 

				The naming has caused confusion, giving the 
				impression that the language is a spin-off of Java, 
				and it has been characterized by many as a 
				marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the 
				cachet of what was then the hot new web-programming language.
